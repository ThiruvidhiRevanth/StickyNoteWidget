## Features

- **Multi-note support:** Create, switch, and delete multiple notes using the toolbar and navigation arrows.
- **Rich text editing:** Format your notes with bold, italic, underline, checklists, and more, powered by [Flutter Quill](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_quill).
- **Color customization:** Choose from a palette to color-code your notes for better organization.
- **Alarm functionality:** Set an alarm for any note; the window pops up centered, always on top, and plays a sound until you stop it.
- **Persistent storage:** All notes and their colors are saved automatically with [shared_preferences](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences).
- **Frameless, draggable window:** Modern sticky note UI using [bitsdojo_window](https://pub.dev/packages/bitsdojo_window) and [window_manager](https://pub.dev/packages/window_manager).
- **Always on top when needed:** When an alarm goes off, the window becomes always-on-top and must be dismissed manually.
- **About dialog:** Quick info about the app in the toolbar.
- **Cross-platform:** Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux desktops.

## How It Works

- **Window Behavior:**  
  The application cannot be minimized or hidden while running. When an alarm is triggered, the app pops up, becomes always on top, and cannot be dismissed except by pressing the Stop Alarm button.
- **Notes Navigation:**  
  Create as many notes as you want. Navigate between them using the arrow buttons below the note.
- **Rich Editor:**  
  Use the toolbar for checklists, bold, italic, underline, strike-through, and more. Each note has its own formatting.
- **Color Picker:**  
  Click the palette icon to pick a color for the current note.
- **Alarm:**  
  Click the alarm icon, choose a time, and you'll get a popup with sound at that time. Stop the alarm using the stop icon that appears.
- **Persistence:**  
  All your notes and their colors are stored on your computer and loaded automatically next time you launch the app.
- **Exit:**  
  Use the close (X) button in the toolbar to save and quit.

## Platform Support

- [x] Windows
- [x] macOS

> **Mobile is NOT supported.**

---

## File Structure

- `main.dart`: Main application code and UI logic.
- `assets/alarm.mp3`: Alarm sound file (add your own if not included).
- `pubspec.yaml`: Dependency list.
- `docs/screenshot.png`: Add a screenshot for your README.

---

## Customization

- **Alarm Sound:** Place your desired `alarm.mp3` in the `assets/` folder and add it to `pubspec.yaml`.
- **Window Size:** Edit the `WindowOptions` in `main.dart` to change the default size or position.
- **Colors and Placeholders:** Change `_availableColors` and `_placeholderSuggestions` in the code to fit your style.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If the window does not appear or is not draggable, ensure `bitsdojo_window` and `window_manager` are properly initialized.
- On macOS, some window features may behave differently due to platform limitations.
- If alarm sound does not play, ensure your `assets/alarm.mp3` is present and declared in `pubspec.yaml`.
